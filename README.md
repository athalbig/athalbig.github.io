## Introduction

I am Web Developer and Designer with a passion for building and working with motivated teams, creating beautiful experiences. I've spent the last two and a half years building websites and internal tools for Meow Wolf, an immersive entertainment company. I am currently attending the Deep Dive Java + Android Bootcamp. My goal is to translate my experience into the field of Technical Project Management.
